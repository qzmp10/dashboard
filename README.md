# dashboard
For this project, I will be creating an admin dashboard to practice my CSS grid skills.
<br>
This project was created for the Admin Dashboard assignment as part of The Odin Project curriculum. I did everything that was demanded and a little extra to further practice my CSS skills. This project was **NOT** optimized for mobile use, but all future projects will be.
